# project

for event management with a focus on prioritization

## features

- [ ] ui: grid w/event info on one side and today list on the other side
- [ ] event info: title, desc, resources, estimation, log
- [ ] today list: planner with mutable and immutable events
- [ ] "done" section to see finished events
- [ ] "later" section to add events quickly
- [ ] auth implementation

## ideas

- animation each time an event gets completed
- progressed and done options for each event
